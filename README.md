# Audio-VU-Meter
_author: Will Knight_

This Metamorphosys design project captures a simple audio VU meter circuit. A microphone on the board picks up ambient audio, and a column of colored LEDs illuminates depending on the ambient sound level. It uses jumpers to connect to an Arduino board, where audio processing and LED control takes place.
