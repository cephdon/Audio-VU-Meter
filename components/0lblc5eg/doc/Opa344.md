###Summary
Single Supply 5-Lead Op Amp

####General Description
The OPA344 and OPA345 series rail-to-rail CMOS
operational amplifiers are designed for precision, low-power,
miniature applications. The OPA344 is unity gain stable,
while the OPA345 is optimized for gains greater than or equal
to five, and has a gain-bandwidth product of 3MHz.
The OPA344 and OPA345 are optimized to operate on a
single supply from 2.5V and up to 5.5V with an input
common-mode voltage range that extends 300mV
beyond the supplies. Quiescent current is only
250µA (max).
Rail-to-rail input and output make them ideal for driving
sampling analog-to-digital converters. They are also well suited
for general purpose and audio applications and providing I/V
conversion at the output of D/A converters. Single, dual and
quad versions have identical specs for design flexibility.
A variety of packages are available. All are specified for
operation from –40ºC to 85ºC. A SPICE macromodel for
design analysis is available for download from www.ti.com.
